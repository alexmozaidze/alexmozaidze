# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexei, but everyone just calls me Alex. I'm a web and software developer that likes playng around with new programming languages. I enjoy simple things and appreciate good code.

I use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/alexmozaidze/) as my main profile, and [GitHub](https://github.com/alexmozaidze/) for mirroring.
